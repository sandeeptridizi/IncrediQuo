// Desktop Issues 

// 1. Increase the size of the Company name and give some space between the logo and the name.
// 2. Slightly darken the blue blur, maybe another 20%. The current one is more whitish, let it be a blue dominated one.
// 3. Change the font for Free Sample Transcript and get some attraction with some graphics or whichever way possible. This should actually stand out.
// 4. The edges of the four images are curved and cut, not consistent.
// 5. Any other alternative of keeping the half blue background to these images? These do not look much appropriate.
// 6. Let the scrolling of the four images be continuous and not like going back to the first one again. This is similar to the Turnaround.
// 7. Keep it as News and Insights, instead of Blogs.
// 8. Keep the heading for the Atlas as - Global Delivery Capability and keep the line below it - Headquartered in India, delivering transcription services to organisations across the globe. Attached the image.
// 9. Please keep the address in the footer.
